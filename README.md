# Textualizer

**Textualizer** is an AI model that detects handwritten or typed alphanumeric characters from images and converts them into editable text. This OCR system is built using ResNet and was developed under an **Intel Mentorship** Program. 
This repository includes the model training and deployment notebooks, along with a link to the [project website](https://sites.google.com/view/textualizer/) containing detailed documentation, which includes the synopsis, pitch video, and the project charter.
