# Textualizer

**Textualizer** is an AI model that can detect handwritten or typed alphanumeric characters from images and convert them to editable text. This OCR model is built using ResNet. 
The project includes model training and deployment notebooks, and a hosted [project website](https://sites.google.com/view/textualizer/) with detailed documentation, which includes a synopsis, pitch video, and the project charter.
